## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to creating and collecting useful tools and scripts for Kubernetes environments. The goal is to simplify common tasks, automate workflows, and provide practical utilities for developers and operators working with Kubernetes.

## Scripts

- **tag-and-pushdate.sh**: Lists image tags for a given container image reference that were created after a specified date. Useful for tracking and managing image versions in container registries. Requires `skopeo` and `jq`.

More scripts will be added as the repository grows.
